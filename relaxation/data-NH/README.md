### NH NMR Relaxation Data for T4L

The data here was kindly shared by Lewis Kay and Eva Meirovitch and corresponds to the following papers: Meirovitch 2012 JPC-B and Goto et al. 2001 JMB 

* T4l_Good_500_800_25.dat : This is a txt file which contains 298 K, 11.7 and 18.8 T data. The six numbers are T1, T1(error), T2, T2(error), NOE, NOE(error) for 11.7 T (500MHz) followed in the same format for 18.8 T (800MHz).

* nt1t2noe.t4 and R1R2NOE.in: Relaxation data at 600MHz, the r1r2noe input is for quadric, the results of which are as follows:
